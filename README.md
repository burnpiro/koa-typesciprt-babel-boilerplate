## Installation

OS X & Linux (make sure that you've got ssl certificate files first, instruction below):

```
npm install
npm run build
npm run start-prod
```

## Generate SSL certificate

To generate local certificate you have to install [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/). If that is done run `./generate-openssl.sh` to create certificate files. You have to follow instructions during generation.

If you want to generate ssl certificate for your production environment you should use one of many solutions like [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

At the end you need `server.crt` and `server.key` files to run server :)

## Database migrations

To run all migrations just run:
```
npm run db-migration
```

If you want to upgrade to specific version use:
```
npm run db-migration up <migration-version-name>
```

If you want to downgrade to version use:
```
npm run db-migration down <migration-version-name>
```

If you want to create migration (follow [ttps://github.com/tj/node-migrate#creating-migrations](https://github.com/tj/node-migrate#creating-migrations)):
```
npm run db-migration create <name>
```

You can always check your current version in `.migrate` file or run:
```
npm run db-migration list
```

## Development setup

To run dev environment:

```
npm run start
```

## Testing

Test env is using Jest, if you want to run tests just call:

```
npm run test
```

or (to run without watcher and with test coverage report)
```
npm run test-coverage
```
